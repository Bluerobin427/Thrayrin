8/12/22 with Flick, Yanny, Corbie, Dale, and Sitss

We spend some time getting character sheets and tokens set up and linked between DnD Beyond and Roll20. It takes about half an hour.

We have all found ourselves in the western foothills of the mountains. We eached received instructions for how to get here independently. Some roads, some scrabbly donkey paths. Eventually we found ourselves in [[Mish'ael|Mish'ael]]. As we approach, no one really pays us attention. It's a small village, 8-10 buildings around the main square, a few other dwellings around the hillside. Maybe 50 total population. We enter the main square. We hear normal village noises, but no one's paying us much mind. The only sign of note is for The Wanderlust Inn. It's very odd how no-one is paying us any mind. The only other instructions we have is "make yourself useful." We all arrive scattered throughout the day. 

Corbie is up with sun, so he arrived earlier in the day, sidled up the bar and says "Be a good boy Corbie." Bartender is a female middle-aged human, red hair, Jenne. "Welcome Corbie."  Corbie's mostly alone, not many day-drinkers. She doesn't know what to do with Corbie, thinks he might be a bit slow. 

Dale arrives next, around lunchtime. He walks in and hears a lunch bell in the distance. Some workers join him in the inn. Gnomes, dwarves, half-orcs, a goblin! Everyone seems to be friends. A strange, small, bird-like creature is in the corner. Dale goes up to the bar and *tries to communicate.* "You need any help?" "It's me and Jennice, we can normally handle the lunch time, we have someone to wash up after lunch. You could buy something, we like selling people things." He gets a vegetarian dish and an ale. He approaches a miller (the goblin), looking for a link to the ale production and an odd job. The goblin hires him on for an afternoon of odds and ends.

Flick arrives next, slightly after lunchtime ends. She arrives while the inn is washing up and cleaning up. "Oh it's a busy day! Do you... speak coherently?" "I sure hope so!" "Great!" She gets a plate of food and some water. Corbie introduces himself.  F- "You know of ways to make yourself useful?" "Be a good boy Corbie." Flick asks the bartender the same question. Corbie mimicks Flick. Jenne- "Not here, but around, there's always people looking for help. Typically the domain of the alderwoman. An older gnome woman who will be around for dinnertime." Alderwoman's name is Dolores.

Sitss and Yanny meet just outside of town and come in together. Yanny is enthusiastic! We're on a journey! Sitss is friendly and curious. We arrive as the dinnerbell ring. Everyone turned up. Some eating, most drinking. 40+ people, very crowded. Sitss, Dale, and Corbie scan the room and identify the group of outsiders. 

Yanny yells out to the crowd: "Hi everyone! Everyone who's here to be useful, join me at this table." The goblin sends drinks over to our table. Yanny pretends to know what's going on. We aren't sure if that's what we're supposed to do to be useful. Dale tells his whole story about how he got his invitation. He worships the Gourd. Corbie cackles: "Praise Heironeous." Yanny tells their story.

A short person with a grey bun walks up. Dolores: "There are friends everywhere! We're glad you're here. I don't doubt that you would have lots of friends, you seem to make friends easily." She introduces herself as [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores Madrigal]]. "You seem to be travelers. We could use someone to deliver a message, maybe bring one back." Dale: "can you be clear, we're having a hard time being clear to " Dolores: "Yeah! Go find woodsmen and see why they haven't brought us lumber and skins. We can't pay you, more of a favor." Flick: "Where are we going?" D: "About two days west-northwest, there's a trail to follow. There's a main camp, lots of little camps. I'm sure you can find them." Dale: "Have they missed a shipment before?" Dolores: "Not really, no." 

Corbie has a copy of his recruitment note that says he's the group leader.

We head to bed, wake up, Dale cooks us breakfast. Yanny tries to ask Corbie about the leadership thing and Corbie sort of just deflects until breakfast is ready. We head out to the forest. Good survival checks, we make our way with a bit of hunting along the way. We get to the forest and immediately hear the sound of chopping and construction. Corbie walks up to the first guy he sees. "We haven't gotten our delivery yet." In Dolores's voice. He's surprised - "A talking bird!" They're approaching unsure of Corbie. Dale steps in. "We were sent from Dolores to check up and see if you're doing alright." "No we're not doing ok! We're woodsmen who can't live in the woods." Flick- "What's wrong with the woods?" "They're dangerous! Our traps got moved to trap us instead! Our mills and camps got attacked by wild creatures! By bears!" Dale: "Have you tried worshiping the gourd god?" A voice in the back- "Hey Mickey! Tell 'em about the plant monsters!" "They said I was crazy, but there were plant monsters!"

Where were the attacks? The lumber milling wagon is about a day to the north. The plant monsters were a bit further on. Dale starts handing out gourd god pamphlets. We debate whether we should go investigate a bit or head back. We decide to investigate, Mickey offers a guide. We help with some camp setup. 

In the morning, Corbie goes to Mickey: "We could send somebody with you." Mickey's confused, but sends Vi with us. She's not enthusiastic, but comes with. Dale makes squirrel liver treats for Corbie and Yanny. +2 temp hp! Before we go, Yanny asks around if anyone else is dying to come with. "The good time to go will be AFTER you come back safely."

We head out, Vi leading. With her leading, we can make it in 5 hours. Eveyone can keep up except Yanny who struggles a bit and takes some damage. Dale tells stories the whole way. When we get close, Vi: "We're getting close, but I don't like this. This is close to where the bears attacked." Yanny suggests we look around. Sitss finds bear claw sharpening marks. Vi decides to stay back and we head into the camp.

We (except Corbie) explore some mangled tents.  Corbie goes to stealthily approach the wagon. Gets ambushed by wasps! Combat!

A swarm goes after Corbie, one after Flick. Sitss eats a bunch of the wasps around Flick. Two more swarms come out! One swarms Sitss and the other approaches Yanny.  Yanny hexes and blasts the ones around Corbie, taking out about half. They seem to resist physical damage, but not spells. Flick takes out the rest of her swarm. "I did it! I slayed the swarm!" Dale does a thing "GOURD!" the wasps resist the burst of holy light. We hear bear noises from the north. 

Corbie disengages and runs from his swarm. The swarm catches up and hits for 4 damage. A bear comes in from the north! Lumbering mostly aimlessly. Has part of a wasp nest in its paw. Probably heard us. Sitss tries to splash them with acid, misses. The swarm misses too. A swarm does 9 damage to Dale, who retaliates with 14 LIGHTNING DAMAGE. It dies. Yanny kills the third swarm around Corbie with a blast. Flick attacks the swarm around Sitss, but misses. The bear lumbers towards us. Dale tries to animal handling it with the wasp nest Corbie got earlier. He succeeds and the bear stops, looks at the honey, back at Dale, and looks torn. 

Corbie pulls out a rapier and attacks the last swarm. Take out about half of the swarm. Sitss finishes it off with some acid. Yanny tries to intimidate the bear away. 19! The bear takes the wasp hive chunk and lumbers away at speed. A second bear pops out of the trees and follows. Yanny: "Problem solved! And now they're gone forever and definitely won't come back!" Dale: "They're going to feel silly if it was just a wasp infestation that attracted the bears!" It looks like the wagon was SMASHED though. Was this a clearcutting operation? It doesn't look shockingly wanton. Yanny checks if we're being watched. High up in a tree they see a raven watching us. They tell the rest of the group. Flick: "Hey bird! You want some food?" The bird flies away.

We go get Vi. "Oh man, the wagon's been destroyed. This is pretty brutal." We decide to go check out the plant monsters. Vi heads back to their new camp. We find the waterfall. We're at the top of the waterfall, we go around to get to the base. Along the way we see a clearing with a ring of stone, 25-30 ft in diameter, about 5 ft tall. There's an open space in the middle with a pile of overgrown rubble. Yanny goes archeologist on it. It's 100-200 years old, roughly elven in construction, but more druidic than racial in particular. It feel like a shrine. Sitss sits to cast Detect Magic as a ritual. Yanny stays to hear whether it's magical. Flick, Corbie, and Dale go to get the abandoned clothes at the nearby pool. Flick sees eyes open from the net of thorny plants on the cliffside. A 6' thorn flies towards her. Miss!

Sitss fires his crossbow, hit! 9 damage. Dale walks up and Thunderwaves. The thorny plant creature makes the save, but takes 4 damage and explodes anyway. Shrubs shudders to life, one attacks Flick, who is holding the clothes. The second attacks Dale for 2 damage! It gets struck by lightning! 3 damage. It's very badly singed. Laurel follows up with an eldritch blast. It explodes. Flick attacks. Crit! 13 damage. Shreds the shrub attacking her. Another thorny plant throws a thorn at Dale, but misses. It climbs up the hill. Two more shrubs! Corbie takes out one. The other shrub goes after Dale. Whiffs! Two go after Sitss. One hits for 4 damage.

Sitss chomps one, misses the second bite. Dale smashes a shrub. Laurel blasts the second thorny plant. 6 damage. Flick pulls out a boomerang! 3 damage! Thorn plant 2 explodes on Dale! The thorns scatter off of Dale's armor. Corbie destroys the last shrub.

We talk to each other. Is this weird? Well, it's not unheard of. The forest can spawn stuff like this. It seems weird that they're so hostile. Laurel points out the raven. "Come down and talk!" A light high-pitched voice, like wind-chimes or light rain: "I don't think that to forest wants you to be here." "Why did you start attacking people?" "I didn't, the plants did!" "Why?" "You're bad! You chopped down our trees!" "We're not from here- we're not bad."

Small humanoid with gossamer wings appears. It's definitely a fey. A pixie. They're generally good-natured. "You know, you don't have axes. So you've never been to the grove? A bit to the west?" "What's to the west?" "Those are our special trees, our mother is unhappy some of them got cut down." We go meet with their mother. After about 15 minutes, we're covered in pixie dust and we find ourselves coming over a ridge. We see a dense grove of special looking trees. Two of them are chopped down. Apparently one of the woodspeople got killed by a big bear, the other got away. We enter the grove.

It's really nice inside. Smells fresh and clean, not quite floral, but lovely. A large clearing with a clear, still pool in the middle. Pixie: "Mother! I'm home! I brought friends! Come sit here, she'll be here soon!" We go sit down as the wind picks up a bit. A voice comes from the trees: "Who have you brought to our home, daughter? Are these the ones who damaged our grove?" "Not us!" "They don't have axes! It couldn't have been them." "But we can send a message."

"Why did you come here, knowing the harm that could befall you?" She's suspicious of the woodsmen, wants them to stay out. Could we help? Get them to live in harmony with the forest? 

Big darkness passed through.

She says that maybe if we talk to the woodsmen, as long as they know anything west of the stream is for the wilds.

She asks about the druids. Have we seen any? They've been gone for 100-200 years. Three generations of humans. She gives us a seed to give to druids if we find any. Shanai *Crack of a branch under the snow* aka. Mother hopes for their presence. 

We make our way back to Mickey's camp. 

We explain what happened. Daisy was the one who died. Jacko made it out alive. Jacko tries to lie. He gets kicked out of the camp. Mickey agrees to the terms of Shanai's agreement. 

We head back to Mish'ael and meet up with Dolores. "We did our quest!" "Your quest? You mean going to ask them about lumber?" We fill her in. "Wow, that's incredible! To think that that little message turned into something so big! And no one paid you! We'll work out a deal to get you inn rooms for a few days. We'll see what comes of this!"

We feel like we've come together a bit as a team, and we feel stronger. We level up!
